# Threat-Detection-in-Distributed-Systems
Intrusion detection in Distributed Systems using a Federated Learning Framework.

This project focuses on detecting intrusions in distributed systems by leveraging a federated learning framework. It enables secure and efficient detection of threats across distributed environments without the need to centralize sensitive data, making it a powerful tool for enhancing cybersecurity in modern networked systems.
